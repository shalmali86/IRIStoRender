IRIS to Render
This project aims to [briefly describe what the project does, e.g., "convert IRIS data into visual representations using Python"]. The repository contains the necessary dependencies, source code, and instructions to run the application.

Project Structure
requirement.txt: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
src/: Source code folder containing implementation files.
data/: Example data files (if applicable).
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the Repository
